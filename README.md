# About the course
RO is a course at TUGraz. In this course we study logic design and computer organisation. We learn to model synchronous digital systems at functional layer as well as structural layer by using the hardware-design language Verilog. Based on this, we discuss typical concepts found in computer organisation: The fetch/execute algorithm, instruction sets, input and output, the stack, interrupt, handshake, memory technologies, direct memory access, virtual memory, and pipelines.
